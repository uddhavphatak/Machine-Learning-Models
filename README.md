# Machine-Learning-Models
These are the models that I made in my college(Applied on Pima Indian Diebetes Dataset)
You can find the Dataset in the branch "CSV File"

1)SVM Model
  The objective of SVM is to draw a line that best separates the two classes of data points.
  SVM generates a line that can cleanly separate the two classes. How clean, you may ask. There are many possible ways of drawing a line that separates the two classes, however, in SVM, it is determined by the margins and the support vectors.
  
2)Random Forest
